# What_you_seed_is_what_you_get
#World Health Organization statistics show that people suffering dementia in 2020 were 50.000.000 (50 million)--->this is 5 times the population of my country which is Greece.
#problem is that it's what you seed that is that you get...![Percentage_of_people_uploading_and_downloading_files](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/015fd7f6-1f08-4b93-914e-706115c611e7)
#Not only agriculture in Greece works in low-rhythms...if it works at all...--->but even our technology attitude is towards this idea...time is passing we don't seed we steal files we download...
#What I see however is many people without social relationships or people carrying their cats and dogs around...or even people with children who are not without problems. We don't even remember to seed...WE don't remember to seed electronically or naturally...this is a process we won't remember doing in a few years..
#Of course asking from  greek government who seriously tries to reform our educational system to take a cost and make a more music oriented educational system would be insane...
#because there is this cost of 70-100 Euros to buy an at least a low-cost instrument, a flute or a guitar...and learn to read the score.
#Here listen if you can--->World health organization statistics say 1,2 million Greeks have ear suffering problems, by 2030 this percentage will be 1,5 million and by 2050 it will be 1,8 million.
#This is a simple comments file--->A beginner in this attempt must sign up and be able to login on github and be able to write a comment which means use this symbol # if he is interested in python for example...of course speaking english is a totally crazy idea if you can't even use # symbol
#to make a comment in python...so my 100 closest people on earth don't know comments, they don't speak english..and many of them suffer dementia or they don't remember or they don't listen , and some of them they have problems with their eyes too.
#The statement is true but truth unfortunately can be horrific/ ugly.
